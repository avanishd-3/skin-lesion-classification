#  EfficientNet v2-M vs Dino v3-Base for Skin Lesion Classification

This project compares EfficientNet v2-M and DINO v3-Base on classifying skin lesions as benign or malignant.

## Project Structure

### Root Directory

- **`README.md`**: Overview of the project directory structure and running instructions
- **`skin_lesion_classification.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook used for training, evaluating, and saving the EfficientNet and DINO models.
- **`.gitignore`**: Files for Git to ignore
- **`.python-version:`** Tells uv which version of Python to use when setting up venv
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Description of projects and its dependencies
  - Similar to Cargo.toml
- **`uv.lock`**: Hash file for project dependencies (do not edit, this is generated by uv)
  - Similar to pnpm-lock.yaml and Cargo.lock

## Usage Instructions

## Getting Data

The data is from the following publicly available datasets: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilya9711nov/isic-2024-synthetic/data

The data is also available at [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xBomJrOHf-5Ae0OxfhhIOa6w7cF4imC9?usp=sharing), which is organized for this project. To use this, download the `skin_lesion_classification` folder and upload it to your Google Drive (it should be in MyDrive).

If not using the Google Drive link, you must have the following zip files. The directory structure shown for `isic-2024-synthetic.zip` is for the unzipped file. To achieve this, delete the lr subfolders from the original dataset and flatten all the hr folders into a single images folders before zipping up your isic-2024-synthetic folder.

### Recommended Runtime (Colab)

1. Upload `skin_lesion_classification.ipynb` to Colab
2. Upload the `skin_lesion_classification` folder to your Google Drive if you haven't already.
3. Connect to a T4 Runtime (available under Runtime>Change runtime type) on Colab.
